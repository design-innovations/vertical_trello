# Vertical Trello List Bookmarklet

After trying the Trello Vertical List chrome extension I was disappointed with the results. I realized I needed a true vertical list for Trello since my cards are so large. I was using ActiveCollab and the vertical list was great so I mimicked it in Trello using a bookmarklet. Let me know if you run into any problems with it. So far it's been working great for me.
